Project description: Based on visual cameras, study object detection and recognition, grasping and placement. This research is supported by the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission Oriental Scholars Project "Robotics and Intelligent Manufacturing", project number: TP2015042 and the horizontal research and development project of Shanghai University "LOAD MOBILE&MULTI Product Intelligent Function Development", project number: 21H00156.

My contribution:  Based on the convolutional neural network, the robot grasping parameter estimation and object detection algorithms are studied to realize the robot's autonomous grasping of unknown targets in an unstructured environment with few samples.

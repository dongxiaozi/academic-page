Dongxiao Han  is a phd of Shanghai Key Laboratory of Intelligent Manufacturing and Robotics at the Shanghai University. Her research interests include lifelong machine learning, robot perception and manipulation, human-robot interactive. Now she focuses on the lifelong learning in object perception and manipulation, which develops deep-learning-based method for object perception(e.g., few-shot learning), new objects learning(e.g., human instructions) and new task learning(e.g. knowledge graph), grasp parameters calculation.

She believes that there is still a long way for intelligent robots to perceive and process the surrounding environment like human, and to complete various tasks autonomously in a complex and dynamic environment. But she is willing to fight for it.

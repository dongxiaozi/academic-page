abstract: In this article, a method for calibrating the relative position
  between dual two-dimensional laser range finders is proposed. This relative
  position is affected by the manufacture or assembling error of mobile
  platform, and this error could reduce the accuracy of localization. This
  article focuses on three-degree-of-freedom calibration, that is, one
  rotational and two translational degrees of freedom. The entire calibration
  process can be summed up into three steps. The first step is to allow the dual
  finders to scan one corner at the same time and then extract the parameters of
  the corner. The second step is to establish a cost function which is
  established according to the direction vector of the line and the
  repeatability of the corners. With this function, the genetic algorithm is
  used to obtain the final calibration result. Moreover, the finder systematic
  error and the statistical error are also considered into this article.
  Simulations and experiments are carried out to verify the proposed method.

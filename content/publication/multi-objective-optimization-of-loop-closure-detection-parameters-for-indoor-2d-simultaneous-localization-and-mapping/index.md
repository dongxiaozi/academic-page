abstract: Aiming at addressing the issues related to the tuning of loop closure
  detection parameters for indoor 2D graph-based simultaneous localization and
  mapping (SLAM), this article proposes a multi-objective optimization method
  for these parameters. The proposed method unifies the Karto SLAM algorithm, an
  efficient evaluation approach for map quality with three quantitative metrics,
  and a multi-objective optimization algorithm. More particularly, the
  evaluation metrics, i.e., the proportion of occupied grids, the number of
  corners and the amount of enclosed areas, can reflect the errors such as
  overlaps, blurring and misalignment when mapping nested loops, even in the
  absence of ground truth. The proposed method has been implemented and
  validated by testing on four datasets and two real-world environments. For all
  these tests, the map quality can be improved using the proposed method. Only
  loop closure detection parameters have been considered in this article, but
  the proposed evaluation metrics and optimization method have potential
  applications in the automatic tuning of other SLAM parameters to improve the
  map quality.
